ORIGINSTAGRAM
--
This project was coded because Instagram changed the post sizes and broke my profile layout.

> A beautifully minimal, responsive profile and gallery web UI like the old Instagram, built entirely with HTML, CSS and JavaScript 
>
> It’s a **simple static website project**:  
> 🖼️ Just put your images in the `assets/posts/` folder  
> 🧠 Add the filenames to the JavaScript array  
> ✅ That’s it — you’re live with your own Originstagram!
